        Question: "  Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. 
                    the function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
                    it should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
                    Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. 
                    Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly. "
